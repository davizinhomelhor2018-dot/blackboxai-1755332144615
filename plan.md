# Implementation Plan for the Romantic Love App

This plan details the creation of a new interactive and romantic page in your Next.js project. The page will display your heartfelt poem with beautiful typography and include a background audio player that plays a romantic music track. We will create a custom audio hook for managing the background music and implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

## Dependent Files and Required Changes

1. **New File: `src/hooks/useAudio.ts`**  
   - **Purpose:** Create a custom hook to handle audio playback (play, pause, error handling).  
   - **Steps:**
     - Import React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
     - Instantiate an `Audio` object with the source set to `/background.mp3`.
     - Implement state variables: `isPlaying` and `error`.
     - Provide functions: `playAudio`, `pauseAudio`, and `toggleAudio` with proper error handling (using `onerror` event).
     - Ensure cleanup on component unmount.

2. **New File: `src/app/love/page.tsx`**  
   - **Purpose:** Create the main love page that renders your message and handles interactivity.  
   - **Steps:**
     - Import necessary React modules, the custom `useAudio` hook, and the Button component from `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
     - Define a functional component that:
       - Renders a full-screen container with a modern gradient background (e.g., using Tailwind classes like `bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-100 to-purple-100`).
       - Displays a prominent title (e.g., `<h1>` with large, elegant typography).
       - Shows your provided love poem in a styled `<blockquote>` or `<p>` element with appropriate line breaks and spacing.
       - Provides a toggle button labeled “Tocar Música” when the audio is paused and “Pausar Música” when playing.
       - Implements error handling by displaying an alert (using a shadcn/ui Alert component or a custom styled div) if the audio fails to load.
       - Uses Tailwind transitions (e.g., `transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out`) for animations on text and button hover.
     - Add client-side event handlers to trigger the audio toggle function.
     - Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management.

3. **New Asset in Public Folder: `public/background.mp3`**  
   - **Purpose:** Store the romantic background music file locally.  
   - **Steps:**
     - Place your mp3 file in the `public` folder under the name `background.mp3`.
     - Ensure the file is optimized for web playback.
     - Implement fallback error handling in the custom hook if the file fails to load.

4. **Optional Update: `src/app/globals.css`**  
   - **Purpose:** Enhance global styling with additional fonts or custom animations if desired.  
   - **Steps:**
     - Optionally add custom font imports (or use Tailwind’s typography classes) to achieve an elegant, romantic look.
     - Define any additional keyframe animations (e.g., fade-in) that complement the interactive elements.

## Feature Integration and UI/UX Considerations

- **Romantic User Interface:**  
  The page employs a soft gradient background, elegant typography, spacious layout, and smooth animations for a refined and heartfelt experience.
  
- **Interactivity:**  
  The interactive toggle button allows the user to control the background music. The text content animates on load for enhanced engagement.

- **Audio Management (AI Feature):**  
  The custom hook (`useAudio`) handles all audio state, error detection, and cleanup. This ensures that the background music plays seamlessly and can be toggled by the user.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Both the hook and the page implement error handling to display an accessible message if the music cannot be loaded or played.

## Testing and Best Practices

- **Testing:**  
  Verify functionality by running the app:
  1. Start the server and navigate to `/love`.
  2. Confirm the poem is displayed with proper formatting.
  3. Click the toggle button to ensure the background music plays/pauses and that any audio errors are handled gracefully.
  
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use TypeScript for strict type checking.
  - Leverage Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for consistency.
  - Ensure proper cleanup in the custom hook to prevent memory leaks.
  - Include ARIA attributes and semantic HTML for accessibility.

## Summary

- Created `src/hooks/useAudio.ts` for managing background music with play, pause, and error detection.
- Developed `src/app/love/page.tsx` to display your romantic poem with a modern, interactive UI and a toggle for background music.
- Integrated the background track by adding `public/background.mp3` and implemented error handling.
- Enhanced the design using Tailwind CSS for a soft gradient, elegant typography, and smooth animations.
- Focused on best practices including TypeScript strictness, accessibility, and component cleanup.
